# Observations.js

Observations.js takes a string of simple JavaScript (one-liners, no blocks) and triggers the given callback whenever the
result of the function changes. Using [Expressions.js](https://github.com/chip-js/expressions-js) it deals with null
values gracefully and supports formatters.

## Usage

### Basic

To install Observations.js you can use npm.

```
npm install observations-js
```
